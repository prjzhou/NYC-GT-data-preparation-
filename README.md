# G&T Results Data Cleaning and Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing the G&T Results dataset from 2017-18 and 2018-19. The goal was to prepare the data for analysis, handle missing values, and visualize key variables.

## Files Included
- `NYC GT Data Preparation.Rmd` - R Markdown file with data cleaning steps and visualizations.
- `NYC GT Data Preparation.pdf` - The knitted PDF version of the R Markdown file, containing the full analysis, code, and visualizations.
- `final_df.csv` - The cleaned dataset after processing.
- `G&T Results 2017-18.xlsx` - The original dataset from 2017-18.
- `G&T Results 2018-19.xlsx` - The original dataset from 2018-19.

## Data Cleaning Steps
1. Standardized column names to ensure consistency.
2. Converted necessary columns to appropriate data types.
3. Handled missing values by removing or retaining them with justification.
4. Merged the two datasets into one final dataset.
5. Created visualizations to analyze score distributions and trends.

## Visualizations
- **Histogram of OLSAT Verbal Scores** - Shows the distribution of scores.
- **Boxplot of Overall Scores by Year** - Compares performance across years.

## How to Use This Repository
- Open `NYC GT Data Preparation.Rmd` in RStudio to view the code and explanations.
- Use `final_df.csv` for further analysis or modeling.
